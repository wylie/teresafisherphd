		<h3>Individual Therapy</h3>
		<p>For adults who are ready to engage with themselves and me with curiosity. Therapy can help people with new or unexpected challenges or feelings (a life transition, a loss, an unexpected event) or longer standing patterns of thoughts or feelings. Therapy can help build awareness, fill your coping toolbox, and improve your relationships.</p>
		<h3>Supervision & Clinical Consultation</h3>
		<p>For clinicians working towards licensure as a Psychologist or seeking support in their work with clients.</p>
		<h3>Community Outreach</h3>
		<p>Do you have a group or organization that could use an experiential workshop to help manage stress or communicate more effectively? I'd LOVE to hear from you!</p>
